# XZZXdY
The repository pertaining to the code used in "Quantum error correcting Clifford deformed surface codes". It uses the Python packages qecsim and qsdxzzx and extends on these when needed 
## Repository structure
### XZZXdY code
This extends qecsim and qsdxzzx. It changes the plaquette structure used in the XZZX code from qsdxzzx to get the XZZXdY structure. Changes are made to the rmps decoder from qecsim to use it on XZZXdY.
### XY code
This extends only qecsim. It changes the plaquette structure used in the XZ code from qecsim to get the XY structure. Some changes are made to the rmps decoder from qecsim to apply it on XY.
